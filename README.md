## Application Structure

### Main Components

- **MainWindow.xaml / MainWindow.xaml.cs**  
  The core UI and logic. Handles user authentication (username), navigation between main pages, and all feature logic (chat, quiz, reminders, history).

- **App.xaml / App.xaml.cs**  
  Entry point for the WPF application, manages resources and startup.

- **Images Folder**  
  Contains assets such as the application logo.

- **Data and Model Classes (not fully listed here):**  
  - `collectUsername`: Handles storing and retrieving the userâ€™s name.
  - `ResponsesClass`: Stores possible responses for the chatbot.
  - `ReminderClass`: Manages reminders.
  - `TrainModelsclass`, `SentimentData`, `SentimentPrediction`: Used for AI model training and sentiment analysis.
  - `QuizQuestionLoad`, `Question`: Handles quiz loading and question logic.

## UI/UX Flow

1. **Username Page**  
   - Prompts the user for a username.
   - Username is stored and used to personalize all subsequent interactions.

2. **Main Page**

## Core Logic Example

### Username Submission

Collects, validates, and stores the username. If a username is not entered, it shows an error message.

```csharp
private void usernameSubmit(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    string collected_name = username.Text.ToString();
    if (collected_name != "")
    {
        collected_username.AssignUsername(collected_name);
        username_page.Visibility = Visibility.Hidden;
        main_page.Visibility = Visibility.Visible;
        username.Clear();
        chat_list.Items.Add("\nHey " + collected_username.UsernameCollection() + ", Welcome to Chatbot AI.");
    }
    else
    {
        MessageBox.Show("please enter the username");
    }
}
```

### Chat History

Stores each chat message in an array list for later retrieval and display.

### Quiz and Scoring

- Loads questions using `QuizQuestionLoad`.
- Tracks `currentQuestionIndex`, user answers, and score.
- Provides feedback at the end of the quiz.

### AI Integration

- Uses `MLContext`, `SentimentData`, and `SentimentPrediction` for ML.NET model training and prediction.
- Sentiment analysis or similar AI features can be triggered based on user input.
